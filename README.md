What are cardiovascular diseases?

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and they include:

    Coronary heart disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle
    Cerebrovascular disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain
    Peripheral arterial disease – disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs
    Rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria
    Congenital heart disease – malformations of heart structure existing at birth
    Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs

According to World Health Organisation,

CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally i.e More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke

From the above facts and figures, we can easily conclude that Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the majority of death and hospitalization, health care expenditures and loss of productivity in developed country

In this Dataset named "Cardiovascular Disease dataset", We have analyzed and gather the insights of dataset provided by Svetlana Ulianova and predict the possibility of a person having Cardiovascular disease based on various parameters specified in this dataset

# Column Description

    id :> It's just the Id no of the row. Not revelant
    age :> It's the age of a person in Days
    gender :> It's the gender of the person
    height :> It's the height of the person in cm
    weight :> It's the weight of the person in kg
    ap_hi :> It's the Systolic blood pressure i.e. Pressure exerted when Blood is ejected in arteries. Normal value : 120mmhg or Below
    ap_low :> It's the Diastolic blood pressure i.e. Pressure exerted when Blood exerts between arteries and heartbeats. Normal Value : 80mmhg or Below
    cholesterol :> It's the Cholestreol value (Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood) of your blood. In Adults, 200 mg/dL is desired with 200 and 239 mg/dL as Boderline High. In Children, 170 mg/dL is desired with 170 and 199 mg/dL as Boderline High
    gluc :> It's the Glucose Level. They're less than 100 mg/dL after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they're less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL

    active :> It contain Binary Values stating whether Person is involved in physical activites or not i.e. {0 : 'Not involved in Physical Activites', 1 : 'involved in physical activites'}
    cardio :> It's our Target Value Binary Values stating whether Person has Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or Not i.e. {0 : 'Not Have CVD', 1 : 'Have CVD'}
